- Sometimes humans remain immortal and cannot be killed by zombies
Sometimes, humans live endlessly with their protection on. Joining the Terrorist team and using !zspawn right before the round starts seems to cause this the most. Not 100% though. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.


remove pistol before giving it?

Proper random zombie.
Last Player disconnects pick another zombie.














  give [dead player] env_entity_dissolver
  set [dead player] env_entity_dissolver AddOutput "target cs_ragdoll"
  set [dead player] env_entity_dissolver AddOutput "magnitude 1"
  set [dead player] env_entity_dissolver AddOutput "dissolvetype 3" (can be disove type 2,1 etc)
 
  // Dissolve the body
  fire [dead player] env_entity_dissolver Dissolve
  
  // Kill the dissolver
  delayed 1 do ent_remove env_entity_dissolver
  
  
  
  pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( STRING(iszItem) );
  CBaseEntity_KeyValues "target cs_ragdoll"
  CBaseEntity_KeyValues "magnitude 1"
  CBaseEntity_KeyValues "dissolvetype 3" (can be disove type 2,1 etc)

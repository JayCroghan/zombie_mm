Installing Zombiemod
=====================
Before continuing, please download and install MetaMod:Source from www.sourcemm.net
Now, copy the zip contents as they are in the zip archive to your cstrike folder.

cstrike/addons/zombiemod/zombiemod_mm.dll
cstrike/addons/zombiemod/zombiemod_mm_i486.so
cstrike/addons/metamod/zombiemod.vdf
cstrike/cfg/zombiemod/models.cfg
cstrike/cfg/zombiemod/downloads.cfg
cstrike/cfg/zombiemod/signatures.kv
cstrike/cfg/zombiemod/zombie_classes.cfg
cstrike/cfg/zombiemod/de_dust.cfg
cstrike/models/player/zombiemod/*Six Models 36 Files*
cstrike/materials/models/player/zombiemod/*Three Materials*

NOTE: If you use sv_downloadurl, then please upload the contents of the models, materials and sound folder to the remote http server.
Otherwise, no one will be able to download the files.
If you want, you can bzip them all to reduce download times even further.







***** New MetaMod Loading Method *****
Simply start metamod with the zombiemod.vdf file in the correct location.
**************************************

***** Old MetaMod Loading Method *****
Once everything is uploaded, open cstrike/addons/cfg/metamod/metaplugins.ini with your favourite text editor.
Add the following line.

addons/zombiemod/bin/zombie_mm
**************************************

Now, restart your server and when you type 'meta list' the following should be printed in your console.

 -Id- Name Version Author Status
[01] ZombieMod v3.0.0  c0ldfyr3 RUN

As long as it says RUN we are ok to go.
If it says 'NOFILE', the line in metaplugins.ini is incorrect, or the zombiemod binaries are not in the correct location.
If it says 'ERROR', then you have a problem and may contact the author.




If you are having issues loading other plugins please disable zombie_game_description in your zombiemod.cfg.




Configuration
====================
The entire CVAR list for Zombie Mod is now in cfg/zombiemod/zombiemod.cfg


Using ZombieMod
====================
To enable ZombieMod, type 'zombies' at the console, or 'rcon zombies' from your client.

---- > PLEASE DO NOT ENTER THIS IN ANY CONFIG FILES TO BE EXECUTED AT STARTUP. < ----
